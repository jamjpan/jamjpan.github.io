<p> I am a fifth-year PhD student in the <a
href="http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/">Database Group</a> at <a
href="https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn">Tsinghua University</a>, advised by <a
href="http://dbgroup.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/ligl/">Prof. Guoliang Li</a>. Before
coming here I was an Associate Consultant and then a Product Support Manager at
<a href="https://www.microstrategy.com/us">Microstrategy</a>. I received my
B.S. and M.Eng. degrees in Bioengineering from the <a
href="https://umd.edu/">University of Maryland, College Park</a> in 2010 and
2012, respectively. During my masters I spent time in the <a
href="http://artjohnson.umd.edu/hpl/index.html">Human Performance
Laboratory</a> under <a href="http://artjohnson.umd.edu">Prof. Arthur
Johnson</a> and worked on medical devices for personal healthcare.

Currently I am mainly interested in spatial data management and focusing on
applications for ridesharing fleet control.

  <h3>Design and Evaluation of Ridesharing Fleet Control Algorithms</h3>
  <figure style="text-align:center;">

    <figcaption>Jargo can evaluate ridesharing algorithms under

  <p>Ridesharing fills the gap between on-demand and fixed-line transportation
  services and has already had a large impact on the personal transportation
  industry. From the computational perspective, ridesharing poses two
  interesting challenges: Given the state of vehicles and customers at a
  particular time, (1) how to optimally match the vehicles and customers?  then
  (2) how to route the vehicles to service their assigned customers? Both of
  these challenges are complicated by the sheer volume of matching and routing
  possibilities in addition to the dynamic nature of the system.
  <p>Unfortunately while the past decade has produced various approaches to
  address these challenges, researchers have only limited understanding of how
  well these approaches work in the real world, due to lack of a suitable
  experimental platform. The first part of this project aims to characterize
  algorithms in terms of real-world performance.  When we tested some
  algorithms under real-time conditions, we found that algorithms behave much
  differently compared to a static setting [<a
  href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol12/p1085-pan.pdf">VLDB'19</a>].  To
  introduce traffic into the environment, we designed a new simulator
  <b>Jargo</b> that is able to simulate traffic by manipulating the timestamps
  of the vehicles in a way controlled by the experimenter, and we demonstrated
  how a traffic-aware algorithm could yield greater service revenue compared to
  one that was unaware [<a
  href="http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol13/p2905-pan.pdf">VLDB'20</a>]. In the
  second part, we now plan to use what we've learned to design new ridesharing
  algorithms.

  <h3>Validating the Airflow Perturbation Device for Measuring Respiratory Resistance</h3>
  Respiratory resistance is an important measurement for diagnosing certain
  diseases including asthma, bronchitis, and pneumonia. However, no instrument
  exists that is easy to use, inexpensive, and widely available. The <b>Airflow
  Perturbation Device</b> (APD) works by variably rotating a screen near the mouth
  to interrupt normal breathing airflow, then measuring the resulting mouth
  pressure to compute the airway resistance. As it only requires a few parts to
  assemble, the APD is lightweight, portable, and inexpensive. But in order to
  convince practitioners and gain clinical acceptance, it must be validated
  against established techniques, such as impulse oscillometry (IOS).
  <p>Performing validation in live patients is expensive and time-consuming.
  Instead, I fabricated a mechanical lung system that could simulate various
  physical conditions, then used this system to APD measurements with those
  from impulse oscillometry. The results showed that the calibrated APD
  measurements were in strong agreement with IOS [<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27006908/">J. Med. Eng. 2013</a>, <a
  href="https://doi.org/10.1115/1.4026695">J. Med. Devices 2012</a>],
  validating its use as a diagnostic tool. Based on these results, the
  mechanical system was then used to confirm that real-world measurement
  variations were due to human respiratory characteristics and not from the APD
  itself [<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/TBME.2012.2204055">Trans. Biomed.
  Eng. 2012</a>].

  <h3>PocketDoc: Portable Pulse Oximetry for Everyone and Everywhere</h3>
  During a medical emergency, blood oxygenation and pulse are usually the first
  vital signs that emergency responders measure in order to determine the
  health status of a patient. For critical emergencies, early response can be
  the difference between life and death, thus anything that can speed up the
  medical response is valuable. In this project, our goal was to develop a
  portable monitoring system that could be easily deployed, with capability to
  transmit to hospitals and ambulances in real time. To overcome the fidelity
  problem of using Bluetooth, we designed a workflow that used the Android USB
  port as a serial port to capture data from an OEM pulse oximeter, then used
  the phone's networking capabilities for transmission over the Internet
  [<a href="https://vimeo.com/27032960">video</a>]. This proof-of-concept
  won the third place Capstone Design Award at our department.

<ul style="list-style:none;padding-left:0;" class="footnote">
<li><sup>1</sup>Chinese is wonderfully expressive.  My name 捷,
or <i>chieh</i> in Wade-Giles, literally means "quick" but is also part of the
word 报捷 (<i>pao chieh</i>) meaning "declaration of good news". I am named so
because at the time of my birth, my dad found out he could go to America for
study, and this was good news.
<li><sup>2</sup>Our son's name 远 (<i>yüan</i>) means "far" because he was born far from his
father's home in Maryland.
